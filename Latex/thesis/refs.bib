	doi = {10.1145/2168556.2168585},
	abstract = {Robust, accurate, real-time pupil tracking is a key component for online gaze estimation. On head-mounted eye trackers, existing algorithms that rely on circular pupils or contiguous pupil regions fail to detect or accurately track the pupil. This is because the pupil ellipse is often highly eccentric and partially occluded by eyelashes. We present a novel, real-time dark-pupil tracking algorithm that is robust under such conditions. Our approach uses a Haar-like feature detector to roughly estimate the pupil location, performs a k-means segmentation on the surrounding region to refine the pupil centre, and fits an ellipse to the pupil using a novel image-aware Random Sample Concensus ({RANSAC}) ellipse fitting. We compare our approach against existing real-time pupil tracking implementations, using a set of manually labelled infra-red dark-pupil eye images. We show that our technique has a higher pupil detection rate and greater pupil tracking accuracy.},

	abstract = {We propose a new model for active contours to detect objects in a given image, based on techniques of curve evolution, Mumford-Shah (1989) functional for segmentation and level sets. Our model can detect objects whose boundaries are not necessarily defined by the gradient. We minimize an energy which can be seen as a particular case of the minimal partition problem. In the level set formulation, the problem becomes a "mean-curvature flow"-like evolving the active contour, which will stop on the desired boundary. However, the stopping term does not depend on the gradient of the image, as in the classical active contour models, but is instead related to a particular segmentation of the image. We give a numerical algorithm using finite differences. Finally, we present various experimental results and in particular some examples for which the classical snakes methods based on the gradient are not applicable. Also, the initial curve can be anywhere in the image, and interior contours are automatically detected.},

Snakes are active contour models: they lock onto nearby edges, localizing them accurately. Scale-space continuation can be used to enlarge the capture region surrounding a feature. Snakes provide a unified account of a number of visual problems, including detection of edges, lines, and subjective contours; motion tracking; and stereo matching. We have used snakes successfully for interactive interpretation, in which user-imposed constraint forces guide the snake near features of interest.},
